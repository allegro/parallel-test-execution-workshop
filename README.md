# Parallel test execution workshop

This repository contains code and instructions used in parallel execution workshop. Examples are based
on [parallel execution](https://spockframework.org/spock/docs/2.3/parallel_execution.html) feature
for [Spock](https://spockframework.org), but concepts shown here can be used with other testing frameworks (JVM or
non-JVM).
