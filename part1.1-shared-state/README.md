# Shared state

In this part you will learn and exercise techniques of eliminating shared state in tests.

First, familiarize yourself with [tests](src/test/groovy) in this module.

- Run tests `./gradlew --rerun-tasks :part1.1-shared-state:test`
- Enable parallel execution
  in [`SpockConfig.groovy`](src/test/resources/SpockConfig.groovy)
- Run tests again `./gradlew --rerun-tasks :part1.1-shared-state:test`
